# OOP Game Show App
## Style Changes

Four kinds of animations have been added. These animations involved making changes to the styles.css file under the new "Animations" section at the bottom.

  - The "start game" overlay fades in and out (JavaScript only)
  - The "current" heart has a beating animation (CSS and JavaScript)
  - Enabled onscreen keyboard keys enlarge when hovered over (CSS only)
  - Onscreen keyboard keys scale up and back down after being pressed or the corresponding keyup event is triggered (CSS and JavaScript)
